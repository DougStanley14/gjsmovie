GJS CELEBRATION OF LIFE — SETLIST B
=====================================
Swap applied:  Track 11  Allman Brothers "Ramblin' Man" (4:50)
               → Supertramp "The Logical Song" (4:11)
Time delta:    -0:39
Total Runtime: 59:23
Target:        59:00–61:30  ✓

Rationale: "The Logical Song" (Breakfast in America, 1979) is Supertramp's defining track and
one of the most perfectly fitting tribute songs in existence — "When I was young, it seemed
that life was so wonderful / a miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical." The Allman Brothers
are excellent but not a named favorite; this swap gives Supertramp their flagship anthem
and keeps all named core artists represented. The road/ramblin' energy is preserved by
Tracks 7, 9, and 14 around it.
