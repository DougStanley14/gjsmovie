GJS CELEBRATION OF LIFE — SETLIST A
=====================================
Swap applied:  Track 6  CCR "Have You Ever Seen The Rain?" (2:40)
               → Genesis "I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)" (4:06)
Time delta:    +1:26
Total Runtime: 61:28
Target:        59:00–61:30  ✓

Rationale: Genesis was a stated core favorite with no representation in the base set.
"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)" (Selling England by the Pound, 1973) is their
most playful, accessible track — joyful and quirky without being abrasive — and slots
naturally into the early-mid energy ramp. The CCR emotional register (bittersweet rain/sun)
is still covered by the overall arc.
