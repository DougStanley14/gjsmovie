GJS CELEBRATION OF LIFE — SETLIST C
=====================================
Swap applied:  Track 12  The Band "The Weight" (4:35)
               → Pink Floyd "Wish You Were Here" (5:21)
Time delta:    +0:46
Total Runtime: 60:48
Target:        59:00–61:30  ✓

Rationale: "Wish You Were Here" (Wish You Were Here, 1975) is one of the great tribute songs
in all of rock — "We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year."
It shifts the late-middle section from communal brotherhood into quiet, direct grief before
the closing pair (Long May You Run + Wild Horses) delivers catharsis. The Band's "The Weight"
is excellent; this swap deepens the emotional descent and makes the final three tracks feel
more inevitable. Best choice if the room needs a clear moment of stillness before the close.

RUNNING TOTALS
--------------
After  4 tracks (Opening):  13:52
After 11 tracks (Mid peak): 49:23
After 15 tracks (Closing):  60:48

NOTE ON SEQUENCING THIS VARIANT
---------------------------------
With Wish You Were Here at Track 12, the closing block becomes four tracks instead of two.
Elvis Costello at Track 13 now functions as an emotional pivot — pulling the room from
stillness back into hopeful questioning — before the final Neil Young / Rolling Stones
farewell. Consider a brief natural pause between Tracks 12 and 13.
